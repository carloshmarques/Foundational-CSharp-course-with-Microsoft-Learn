# Write your first C# code

Get started by writing code examples to learn the basics of the C# syntax

Learning objectives

After you complete this module, you'll be able to:

* Write your first lines of C# code
* Use two different techniques to print a message to a text console
* Diagnose errors when you type code incorrectly
* Identify different C# syntax elements like operators, classes, and methods
* This module is part of these learning paths
* Build .NET applications with C#
* Build web apps with ASP.NET Core for beginners

## Introduction

* Unit 1

## The C# programming language allows you to build many types of applications, like

* Business applications to capture, analyze, and process data
* Dynamic web applications that can be accessed from a web browser
* Games, both 2D and 3D
* Financial and scientific applications
* Cloud-based applications
* Mobile applications

### But how do you begin to write an application?

* Applications are all made up of many lines of code that work together to achieve a task.
* By far, the best way to learn how to code is to write code.
* It's encouraged that you write code along with the exercises in this module and the others in this learning path.
* Writing code yourself in each exercise and solving small coding challenges will accelerate your learning.

#### You'll also begin learning small foundational concepts and build on them with continual practice and exploration

* In this module, you'll:
* Write your first lines of C# code.
* Use two different techniques to print a message as output.
* Diagnose errors when code is incorrect.
* Identify different C# syntax elements like operators, classes, and methods.

##### By the end of this module, you'll be able to write C# code to print a message to the standard output of a console, like the Windows Terminal. These lines of code will give you your first look at the C# syntax, and immediately provide invaluable insights

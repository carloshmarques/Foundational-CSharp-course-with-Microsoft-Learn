## 🤔 **About the project**

* This repository is a record of monitoring and maintenance of the software with the aim of consulting and updating it as deemed necessary at a given time.
* This course was created on the Microsof Learn website and offers a comprehensive introduction to C# programming,
covering its main concepts, syntax and practical application in software development.
* Through hands-on exercises and projects, I will learn (or so I hope) the fundamentals of C#, including variables,
data types, control structures, and object-oriented programming principles.
* By the end of this course, I hope to have gained the practical skills and knowledge necessary to confidently leverage C# to create applications.

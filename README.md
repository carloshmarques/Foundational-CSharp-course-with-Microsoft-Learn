## 🤔 **About the project**

* This repository is a record of monitoring and maintenance of the code used in the course,
with the aim of consulting and updating it as necessary and at an opportune time and for learning purposes only.
* This course was created on the Microsof Learn website and offers a comprehensive introduction to C# programming,
covering its main concepts, syntax and practical application in software development.
* Through hands-on exercises and projects, I will learn (or so I hope) the fundamentals of C#, including variables,
data types, control structures, and object-oriented programming principles.
* By the end of this course, I hope to have gained the practical skills and knowledge necessary to confidently leverage C# to create applications.

---

## ⚡ **Installation**

* The learning process and its definitions are provided by the Microsoft Learn website, so additional instructions are provided there.

---

## 🚀 **Usage**

* This course repository and its use depend entirely on current developments and are presented as you go.
It consists of 6 parts and each part is subdivided into learning modules, which in turn are subdivided into smaller units.
* See more on the Microsoft Learn website.

 ## 🌲 **Project tree**

* This repository includes a GitHub workflow that generates a treemap visualization. The workflow is triggered on every push to the main branch.
* The treemap is created using [insert library or framework name here], and the workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/treemap.yml`.
* For more details on the workflow, see the workflow file.

## 📝 **Additional notes**

* About Visual Studio Code usage.
* Regarding the use of Visual Studio Code, although this course is focused on using Visual Code, I personally prefer the Visual Studio IDE, so I will install Visual Code and configure it, but I will continue to use Visual Studio Community whenever i can use it, but i like Visual Code though.
* Regarding the final part of the course, as the modules are oriented towards visual code and I'm not a big fan of it, perhaps because I started my studies in Visual Studio and I'm used to it, I just went through the modules and answered the questions questions, then I took the certification exam and I am pleased to announce that I passed with 97% correct answers.

             * Recap
                Here are a few important things to remember from this unit:

                Code debugging is a crucial skill in the software development process that every developer learns.
                The best approach to debugging your applications is to use a debugger, not rereading your code five times or adding console.WriteLine() statements throughout your code.
                Debuggers enable you to pause your application, step through your code line-by-line, and observe the state of variables and function parameters.

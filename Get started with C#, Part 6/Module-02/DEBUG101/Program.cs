Recap
Here are a few important things to remember from this unit:

Use breakpoints to pause code execution during a debug session.
Use Step Into from the Debug controls toolbar to observe the next executable code line.
Use Step Out from the Debug controls toolbar to advance through the current method and back to the code line that called the method.

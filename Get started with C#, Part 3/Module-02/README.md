* 37 min Module 7 Units

## Use code blocks with more confidence, understanding how they impact the visibility and accessibility of both higher and lower-level constructs in your code

### Learning objectives

#### After you complete this module, you'll be able to

* Understand the impact of declaring and initializing variables inside and outside of code blocks
* Remove code blocks in if statements to improve readability when there's only one line of code in the body of the code block
* Describe the purpose and scoping hierarchy for namespaces, classes, and methods

##### Prerequisites
